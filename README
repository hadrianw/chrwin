chrwin
------

Change root window.

chrwin operates as proxy between X11 server and client. On creation of windows by client
chrwin replaces root window XID with XID supplied by command line argument.

Usage
-----

Because xauth is not handled and fake display number is hardcoded manual xauth modification is needed:
xauth add $(xauth list "$DISPLAY" | sed "s/$DISPLAY  /:123  /")

chrwin PARENT_XID [cmd [args]]

Example
-------

chrwin $(tabbed | head -n 1 &) st

st will be embedded by tabbed. X clients started in st will show up in next tabbed tab.

TODO
----

- Handle windows created for menus.
- Do not change CreateWindow request. Send ReparentNotify instead later.
- Keep only one instance of chrwin running. 
- Generate X display number.
- Handle MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE authentication internally.
- Lots of polish.
